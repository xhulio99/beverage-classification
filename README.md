<h1>Bar Products Classification with Transfer Learning</h1>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>The problem this project aimed to solve was to accurately classify different Bar products based on images. This can be a challenging task due to the high variability in the appearance of the products and the similarities between some of them.</p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>To solve the problem, Transfer Learning was used to fine-tune a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the image classification task. Specifically, the model used was the MobileNetV2 model, which was trained on the ImageNet dataset. The last layer of the MobileNetV2 model was replaced with a new layer that was trained on the Bar products dataset.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The dataset used to train and test the model consisted of a total of 720 images, with 120 images for each of the six products. The images were collected from various sources, including Google Images and stock photo websites. Some preprocessing steps were performed on the images, including resizing and grayscale conversion.</p>
<h2>Model Architecture</h2>
<p>The model architecture consisted of a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model with the last layer replaced. The new layer included a Dense layer with six neurons and a Softmax activation function.</p>
<h2>Jupyter Notebook</h2>

<p>In the notebook, each step is explained in detail with code snippets, markdown cells, and visualizations.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>To run the code, you need to install the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tensorflow</li>
	<li>Keras</li>
	<li>Numpy</li>
	<li>Pandas</li>
	<li>Matplotlib</li>
</ul>
<p>You can install these dependencies using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To run the Jupyter Notebook, you can download the AI-Explorer from a Coffee Machine to the world.ipynb file from the GitHub repository and open it in Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can run the notebook using Google Colab. To do this, simply upload the AI-Explorer from a Coffee Machine to the world.ipynb file to your Google Drive and open it in Colab. You will need to install the necessary dependencies in the Colab environment by running the following command in a code cell:</p>
<pre><code>!pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The model achieved an accuracy of 97.81% on the test set, which demonstrates its effectiveness in classifying different Bar products.</p>

<h2>Limitations and Potential Improvements</h2>
<p>One limitation of the model is that it may not perform well on images with different lighting conditions or backgrounds. In the future, this could be addressed by collecting more diverse and representative images for the dataset. Additionally, more advanced techniques, such as object detection or segmentation, could be used to improve the accuracy of the model.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of Transfer Learning in solving the problem of Bar products classification. By fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN, the model was able to achieve a high accuracy on a challenging image classification task. The detailed walkthrough provided in the Jupyter Notebook can be useful for anyone interested in learning about image classification and transfer learning, and the model can be further improved by incorporating more advanced techniques or collecting a more diverse dataset.</p>
